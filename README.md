# Sentiment Analysis of Tweets about Apple and Google Products
![Sentiment Analysis](Image/Sentiment_Analysis_Projects.png)

## Problem Statement
- Social media platforms like Twitter provide valuable insights into how users feel about technology products such as those from Apple and Google. Understanding customer sentiment can help these companies improve their products, manage their reputation, and design better marketing strategies.

- This project aims to build a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model that can automatically classify the sentiment of tweets mentioning Apple and Google products. The model should identify whether the sentiment expressed in each tweet is positive, negative, or neutral.

- To simplify the problem, we will first focus on a binary classification task (positive vs. negative) as a proof of concept, and then extend to a multiclass classification (positive, negative, neutral).

## Objectives
- Load and explore the dataset (tweets from CrowdFlower).
- Preprocess tweets (cleaning text, removing stopwords, handling emojis).  
- Build a simple baseline model(Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes) for binary sentiment classification (positive/negative).  
- Extend the model to handle multiclass classification (positive, negative, neutral).  
- Evaluate the model (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).  
- Provide insights on how this model can be useful for businesses.  

## Workflow
1. Import libraries  
2. Load dataset  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Data Preprocessing (cleaning tweets)  
5. Feature Extraction (Bag of Words / TF-IDF)  
6. Model Building (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.)  
7. Model Evaluation  
8. Advanced NLP (Word Embeddings, LSTM, or Transformer-based models)  
9. Conclusion & Recommendations
